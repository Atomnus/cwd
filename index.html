<p>Chronic Wasting Disease, or CWD, is a progressive, fatal disease that is found in deer, elk, moose, and reindeer - generally, a mammal of the deer family, cervids. 
  CWD is 100% fatal. Though it is relatively rare, CWD has been found in wild or captive cervids in 25 states, three Canadian Provinces, Norway, and South Korea.
    Essentially, this disease attacks an animal's proteins, eventually causing the death of its brain cells.</p>
