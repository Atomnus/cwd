    <h4>Overview</h4>
<p class="tab">Chronic Wasting Disease, or CWD, is a progressive, fatal disease that is found in deer, elk, moose, and reindeer - generally, mammals of the deer family, cervids. 
  CWD is 100% fatal. Though it is relatively rare, CWD has been found in wild or captive cervids in 25 states, three Canadian Provinces, Norway, and South Korea.
    This disease attacks the animal's proteins, eventually causing the death of its brain cells.</p>

    <h4>Transmission, Details, and Dangers</h4>
    <p class="tab">CWD is not caused by a virus or bacteria. It is a member of a group of diseases known as transmissible spongiform encephalopathies or TSEs. These are a group
      of rare degenerative brain disorders characterized by tiny holes that give the brain a "spongy" appearance when viewed under a microscope. Surprisingly, some
      of these famously fatal TSEs can be contracted by humans. These include Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, kuru, and familial fatal insomnia.</p>
